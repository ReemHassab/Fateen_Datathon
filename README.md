### **Why use gamification in fintech apps?**

- **Simplifies complex topics:**Â Gamified content like games and short videos make complex financial concepts easy to understand
- **Builds community:**Â In some cases, the right gamification mechanisms can foster a sense of community among users. For instance, leaderboards build an environment of healthy competition amongst peers
- **Boosts engagement:**Â Gamification builds repeat behaviours with a action-reward mechanism, encouraging users to come back to the app regularly
